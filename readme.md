# Tiny Dungeon

Tiny Dungeon is written using oriented programming methods learned in week 5 at the School of Code. I created this as my submission for the Friday hackathon over the course of two days\

## Details

Tiny Dungeon is a short, event driven, object oriented text RPG. The player can choose from three characters, each with varying health (HP) and attack points (AP). The game is then played across nine different rooms which the player clicks through in search of three keys which will unlock the exit. Room and enemy names are randomly assigned and enemy HP, AP, locations, names and types are randomly generated each time. I felt the random nature of this game would go some way to arresting it's linear nature and ui making each play through and outcome different each time. The player has access to a single health potion which will return 30HP to the player stats and expire after use.
Finding three keys and exiting the dungeon (or death) will end the game.
